<a href="/ideas">{{< figure src="IDEAS-Lab.png" height="" width="3000">}}</a>  <font size="4">We aim to bring a holistic approach that accounts for the systems-level and life-cycle impact of the design and operation of novel aircraft on the environment. We explore the new aircraft design space created by revolutionary aerospace technologies, such as electrified and hydrogen propulsion, to maximize the environmental and operational benefits through the use of physics-based and reduced order modeling, probabilistic design methods, and systems engineering principles.
