A few weeks ago, PhD students Max and Paul passed their Prelminary Exam - a 90-minute oral exam based on the courses they took in their first year as PhD students.
This is a major milestone in the PhD journey because they advanced from PhD Pre-Candidacy to PhD Candidacy.
To celebrate, Prof. Cinar treated all of the PhD students to lunch at Bigalora Wood Fired Cucina, a short drive from North Campus.

Everyone enjoyed the wood-fired pizzas, desserts, and beautiful Ann Arbor sunshine on the restaurant's outdoor patio.
Thanks to Prof. Cinar for taking the PhD students to lunch!
