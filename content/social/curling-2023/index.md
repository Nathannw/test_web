The **Detroit Curling Club** hosted its annual "Guest Night" on Saturday, January 28th.
Paul, who has been curling for nine years, invited lab-mates Huseyin and Max (along with two other friends) to learn how to curl.

The evening consisted of a 45-minute pre-training lecture, 30-minute on-ice practice session, and then a 90-minute scrimmage against some other new curlers.
In the scrimmage game, the final score was tied 2-2.
All IDEAS Lab members enjoyed the evening!
