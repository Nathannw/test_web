abstract: "The study of rocket exhaust ground cloud evolution has been the focus of numerous research efforts. These studies aim to understand and predict the transport and dispersion of launch vehicle ground clouds under a variety of meteorological conditions, which consist of high concentrations of toxic acidic mixtures and particulate matters. Such understanding is critical for assessing environmental impacts and ensuring the safety of the areas surrounding the launch pad. However, the uncertainties increase with the involvement of atmospheric conditions. This study focuses on near-field and far-field acidic deposition, utilizing a Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model (LPDM) as a principal model. Additionally, this study developed a separate cloud rise model with the objective of accurately predicting the vertical trajectories of rocket exhaust ground clouds, which are crucial for far-field deposition predictions. The near-field, far-field, and cloud rise models were validated using observed data from recent studies. Our results demonstrated good agreement when compared with the observed data. This model was integrated with the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model to provide atmospheric data, enabling comprehensive simulations at any location and time in the US. The model extended its predictions to include the Starship integrated flight test launches at SpaceX Starbase launch pad in Boca Chica, Texas. The results, when combined with wind statistics, indicate a significant potential for the ground cloud to reach the residential areas. Although the propellant chosen for Starship is LOX/LCH4, nitric oxide (NO) can be formed during the plume entrainment process, posing a risk to human health."
