abstract: "As the annual number of space launches continues to increase, new spaceports may need to be created in order to keep up with demand. Development of successful and sustainable spaceports requires a holistic understanding of the impact they have on the host community. Economic factors have historically been the primary drivers in the development of new spaceports, but purely quantitative economic data often fails to fully capture the lived experience of local residents. Technical research is beginning to address the environmental impact of spaceports, but little literature exists on the social impact of spaceport development and operation. Additionally, existing literature typically focuses on an individual spaceport, resulting in a research gap regarding community effects common to multiple developments. Failure to properly identify, understand, and address these commonalities may lead to increased cost, both monetarily and socially, for new spaceport developments in the future. This paper seeks to present a synthesis of existing literature on the community effects of spaceport developments throughout the world, placing a focus on non-economic social impacts. Commonalities between developmental approach and community structure are analysed with the intent to draw parallels between spaceport developments despite situation differences. Finally, a list of core documented impacts noted throughout the literature is presented."
