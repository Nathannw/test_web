abstract: "Electrified aircraft propulsion concepts are rapidly emerging due to their huge potential in fuel saving and mitigating negative environmental impact. In order to perform a linear technology progression and fairly assess the impacts of powertrain electrification, it is important to first establish parametric state-of-the-art baseline vehicle models with advanced technologies matured by 2030. For a thin haul (19-passenger) turboprop size class and a regional turboprop (50-passenger) size class, a current state-of-the-art technology reference aircraft (TRA) is identified and modeled using a multi-disciplinary analysis and optimization environment. Viable technologies for airframe and conventional propulsion system are then identified which are expected to be available by 2030. These technologies are parametrically infused in the TRA models to create advanced technology aircraft models, which will serve as the baseline models for future studies of powertrain electrification."
