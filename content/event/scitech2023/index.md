AIAA SciTech Forum is the world’s largest event for aerospace research, development and technology. Dr. Cinar will participate in various activities throughout the forum:

**Digital Workforce Development - Best Practices Panel**, *9.30 am - 11 am, Tuesday, January 24, @ Chesapeake 12*

Dr. Cinar is one of the speakers on the "Digital Workforce Development - Best Practices" Panel. This panel is moderated by Dr. Olivia Pinon Fischer (Georgia Institute of Technology) and organized by Dr. John Matlik (Rolls Roce Corporation) of AIAA's Digital Engineering Integration Committee. The panel speakers are Drs. Gokcin Cinar, Olivia Pinon Fischer, Elizabeth Generas, Alicia Kim, and Marianna Maiaru. The panel presents ongoing activities to educate the future engineers (from K-12 to graduate school) on digital engineering topics, and discussed how the academia and industry can join forces to train the workforce for digital transformation. 

Dr. Cinar's presentation introduces the new x88 course series offered at the University of Michigan. The x88 series aim to teach the undergraduate students systems engineering principles, model-based systems engineering tools and methods, and essential business and leadership skills. 

**Emissions and Sustainability Task Force Mid-point presentation**, *2 pm - 3 pm, Wednesday, January 25, Potomac C*

AIAA's Emissions and Sustainability Task Force will give a mid-point presentation based on their work and findings from the past 6 months. The Task Force members were appointed in Summer 2022 to define AIAAs role in enabling industry success at reducing impact to climate change. The members of this Task Force span across the industry, government, and academia. The presentation will be presented by Dr. Stephen Barret (MIT) and Dr. Matthew Orr (Boeing). 

**Electrified Aircraft Safety and Mission Planning - Technical Session**, *9.30 am - 10.30 am, Wednesday, January 25, Camellia 1*

Dr. Cinar will chair a technical session organized by the Electrified Aircraft Technology Technical Committee.
