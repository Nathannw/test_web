The AIAA/IEEE Electric Aircraft Technologies Symposium (EATS) connects both aerospace and electrical engineers to share technological developments and challenges as they work towards electrifying aicraft systems.
During the EATS conference, there will be multiple keynote addresses, discussion panels, and over 30 technical sessions to share knowledge between the aerospace and electrical engineering communities.
This year, EATS will be held in conjunction with the AIAA Aviation Forum, which brings members of the aerospace industry together to discuss aircraft design and development in the context of air traffic operations, technology, and policy.

Members of the IDEAS Lab will be participating in the following events (listed in chronological order):

**Emissions & Sustainability Task Force Wrap Presentation**, *Tuesday, June 13, 13:00-15:00, Harbor E*

Prof. Cinar has served as a member of the Emissions & Sustainability Task Force and will be presenting part of the Wrap Presentation.
Each AIAA Task Force works for a one-year period on a topic relevant to AIAA and the aerospace industry, and then shares their findings with the public.
As the Emissions & Sustainability Task Force's work comes to a close, its main findings and plans for a more sustainable aerospace industry will be shared.

**EATS Networking Event**, *Tuesday, June 13, 18:00-19:00, Bayview Room (32nd Floor)*

All are welcome to meet other professionals whose work and research interests lie in electrified aircraft technologies and sustainable aviation.

**Technical Session - EATS-03, Electrified Aircraft Design & Mission Operation I**, *Wednesday, June 14, 9:30-11:30, Gaslamp B*

Paul Mokotoff will be presenting the lab's first conference publication entitled "Sizing and Operational Analysis for Hybrid Electric Aircraft: A feasibility study for the regional market".
The objective of this research is to explore the feasibility of integrating hybrid electric aircraft (HEA) into an airline fleet.
In order for HEA to permeate the commercial aviation market, airlines must be able to maintain their operational capabilities by using their existing flight schedules and continue to meet growing passenger demand for air travel.
This research establishes a foundation for evaluating HEA integration into commercial aviation and will allow for future work in understanding the tradeoffs between the airlines' operations metrics and carbon dioxide emissions.

**Opening Remarks - Keynote Presentation**, *Wednesday, June 14, 11:15-12:15, Harbor E*

As the Co-Chair of the Organizing Committee, Prof. Cinar will deliver opening remarks before the first keynote presentation of the EATS Conference.

In addition to the previously mentioned events, Prof. Cinar will also be a Session Chair at the following two technical sessions:

- **EATS-13, Electrified Aircraft Design & Mission Operation II**, *Wednesday, June 14, 15:30-17:30, Gaslamp B*
- **EATS-29, Electrified Aircraft Propulsion, Architectures, & Systems Integration II**, *Friday, June 16, 9:30-11:30, Gaslamp C*
