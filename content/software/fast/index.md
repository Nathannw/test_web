**Overview**

The Future Aircraft Sizing Tool (FAST) is an innovative, open-source, MATLAB-based aircraft design and analysis software developed by the IDEAS Lab at the University of Michigan. FAST was developed as part of a research project funded by the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate's Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration (EPFD) project. This tool facilitates the design and analysis of both conventional and electrified aircraft concepts. It supports any propulsion architecture and requires minimal knowledge and inputs from the user about the design, making it a versatile tool for aerospace engineers, researchers, and enthusiasts.

**Key Features:**

- **Aircraft Conceptual Design Tool:** FAST is designed for rapid exploration of the design space at the early stages of aircraft development. It supports the evaluation of thousands of configurations, offering rapid calculations essential for early-stage analysis.
- **Minimal Input Requirements:** FAST requires very few inputs to design an aircraft. Users only need to provide the range, payload, vehicle class, and propulsion system type to start designing a new concept.
- **Embedded Historical Database with Predictive Modeling:** FAST uses a historical database of over 200 aircraft and engines, compiled from type certificate data sheets (TCDS) provided by governing bodies like the FAA and EASA, and supplemented by existing databases. This open-source, collaborative database is continuously updated. FAST employs Gaussian Process Regressions (GPRs) to predict unknown aircraft parameters from fundamental requirements such as range and payload weight, as well as designer-specified constraints like thrust-to-weight ratio and wing loading. This allows FAST to function with minimal input by estimating missing variables required for sizing analysis and making future projections on key performance parameters.

Predicting Aircraft Design Parameters using Gaussian Process Regressions on Historical Data. AIAA SciTech Forum 2025. Paper submitted, awaiting decision.*")
- **Versatile Design Capabilities:** FAST supports a wide range of aircraft concepts, from conventional designs to advanced electrified aircraft. It can size and design both fully electric and hybrid electric aircraft, powered by batteries and/or hydrogen fuel cells.
- **Propulsion Architecture Flexibility:** FAST can represent and size any propulsion architecture and unconventional energy sources, providing unparalleled flexibility in design and analysis. This facilitates the exploration and development of next-generation electrified aircraft.
- **Embedded Physics-based and Data-driven Models:** FAST uses a combination of physics-based and data-driven models for increased accuracy beyond conventional methods.
- **Future Technology and Key Performance Parameter Projection:** FAST leverages historical data, regressions, and physical drivers to predict future trends in aircraft design. This capability enables FAST to size and analyze aircraft concepts up to the year 2050, projecting key performance parameter values into the future. These insights can support further studies on cost and emission reduction strategies.

Historical Trends and Future Projections of Key Performance Parameters in Aircraft Design. Manuscript under progress.*")
- **Detailed Mission Performance Analysis:** FAST offers full mission history, time step by time step, for flight mission performance evaluation. This allows for both design and off-design analyses.

- **Integrated Visualization Feature:** FAST provides visualizations of the aircraft geometry's outer mold line and schematic representations of its propulsion architecture. Users can create custom geometries or utilize preset configurations available in FAST. The tool dynamically updates to reflect changes in the aircraft's shape and size as the design process converges, allowing users to see how the aircraft's dimensions change from its initial condition.
