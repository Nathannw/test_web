Nawa Khailany is an undergraduate senior studying Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan (U-M). Since joining the IDEAS lab, Nawa has been involved in researching the operations of regional airliners. This summer they will also partake in the Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering (SURE) program, where they will develop modeling tools for hybrid-electric aircraft that aim to reduce commercial aviation’s impact on the environment.

During their time at U-M, Nawa’s work on design projects has provided them with an opportunity to explore radical solutions and novel concepts at the cutting edge of Aerospace research. Design projects include the conceptual design of a Hydrogen powered airliner, as well as the design, manufacturing, and testing of a propeller aimed at operating on the surface of Mars.

Outside of academics, Nawa loves producing music, watching movies, playing soccer, and kart racing.
