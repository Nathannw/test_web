Maxfield Arnson is a graduate student research assistant in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan. While originally interested in hypersonic airbreathing propulsion, his research interests evolved into sustainable aviation and electric and hydrogen propulsion during his undergraduate studies. 

In his undergraduate studies, Maxfield participated in the College of Engineeringâ€™s Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering (SURE) program. He researched the feasibility of using hydrogen fuel cells in a turboelectric propulsion system. During his senior year, his design teams worked on a liquid hydrogen powered airliner and modifying a JetCat turbojet engine to use gaseous hydrogen in place of kerosene as a fuel. 

Maxfield is an alumnus of the M-Fly Aero Design team, and the former president of the Luther Buchele Student Cooperative, a student housing group focused on providing affordable housing for students.
