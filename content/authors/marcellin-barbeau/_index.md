Marcellin Barbeau is a junior studying Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan. As a systems engineering co-op for Collins Aerospace, he spent 8 months working on Air Combat Test and Training systems for the Navy. His responsibilities included writing automated regression tests, debugging system integration failures with F35s, and writing software to improve data analysis and mission debriefing. As a part of the IDEAS Lab, Marcellin is working with the team on finding an innovative solution which can effectively integrate MBSE architecture models with MDAO’s optimization tools. 

While at Michigan, he is the electronics lead for the Human Powered Submarine team, working to bring performance metrics and electronic controls to improve handling and shape future submarine design parameters. Earlier, he was on the software subteam of MBOP, a project team which used MBSE methods to create a 2U sensor suite payload which was launched on Blue Origin's NS-24 mission. Marcellin is also a member of the Aerospace Honor Society, Sigma Gamma Tau (SGT). 

Outside of academia, Marcellin loves astrophotography, exploring abandoned mines, and also works as a professional stuntman.
