Santiago's passion lies in the field of sustainable aviation, whether it be electric or hydrogen powered aircraft. He particularly is interested in the unconventional design space sustainable solutions open up. Beyond the world of aviation, Santiago's other interests include his beloved Pittsburgh Steelers and Michigan Wolverines football, ultimate frisbee, Lego, and biking.
