Dr. Swapnil Jagtap is a post-doctoral research fellow of IDEAS Lab in the Aerospace Engineering department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. At the IDEAS Lab, the specific focus of his research is on transformative sustainable aviation technologies with the application of model-based systems engineering and SysML. He is working on sustainable aviation technologies and advanced concepts such as electrified and hydrogen propulsion, among others, along with design and optimization of aircraft and their operations.

Dr. Jagtap holds a Ph.D. degree from Imperial College London, UK. His Ph.D. research was focused primarily on low-carbon aviation technologies for mitigating climate change impacts and minimizing the human and environmental health impacts of aviation. Dr. Jagtap's PhD research problem title was ‘Evaluation of technology and energy vector combinations for decarbonising future subsonic long-range aircraft’. He also holds M.S. in Aerospace Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, and Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Mumbai. More information can be found here.

Dr. Jagtap has been named in the: Forbes 30 under 30 list of innovators, disruptors, and game-changers ('manufacturing and industry' category); Georgia Tech 40 under 40 list of innovators, trendsetters, and people to watch; and MIT Technology Review Innovators Under 35 list; for his disruptive and pioneering work in hydrogen aircraft technology. 

Prior to joining the IDEAS Lab, Dr. Jagtap worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Global CO2 Initiative in the Mechanical Engineering department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. There he worked on an industry sponsored project on the prospect for CO2-made sustainable aviation fuel in the USA. The aspects considered in this project were environmental and social lifecycle analysis and economic examination of the emerging technology of sustainable aviation fuel manufacturing.
