Yilin Deng is a master’s student in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan. Prior to that, he received his B.Eng. degree from the University of Nottingham in Aerospace Engineering in 2022. During his undergraduate study, he participated in research projects in analyzing symmetric and asymmetric aircraft wings using CFD and simulating the stiffness of aircraft wings using FEM. His research interest lies in sustainable civil aviation, including but not limited to more electric aircraft, emission reduction, noise reduction and sustainable aviation fuel. He is now a research assistant at the IDEAS lab at U-M, working on a hybrid electric aircraft operation project, advised by Prof. Gökçin Çınar.
