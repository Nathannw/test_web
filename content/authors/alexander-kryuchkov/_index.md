Alexander is a second-year master's student in aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan. He graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder in 2021, where he was researching human deconditioning and performance in space. His research was looking at the effects of stochastic resonance on task performance, specifically visual tasks.
He started his master's degree at U of M to pursue his interest in electric propulsion and sustainable flight. He hopes to contribute to making aviation for the planet and for the people. He also loves cats.
