Rawan is an undergraduate senior studying Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan. Rawan is working at the IDEAS Lab over the summer (2023) through the SURE (Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering) program. She creates pages on the IDEAS lab website to shed light on aspects of sustainable aviation that are not readily accessible and provides a deeper look into the work done at the IDEAS lab. Rawan will also use systems engineering concepts to research hydrogen propulsion systems with other lab members. 

Rawan has always been interested in sustainability, but her interests became vested when she joined the M-SAAVE HUM (Michigan Sustainable Aerospace Vehicle Engineering - Humanitarian UAV Mission) project team at the University of Michigan. The team is working on producing a UAV capable of medical supply drop and aerial surveillance for use in sub-Saharan Africa. She was the M-SAAVE HUM Risk Manager and Models Based Systems Engineering Team Captain for the 2022-23 year. Rawan is also a part of SGT, the aerospace honor society, and is interested in spacecraft navigation, spacecraft dynamics, and propulsion systems. 

Outside of aerospace Rawan enjoys fashion, cooking, and watching anime.
