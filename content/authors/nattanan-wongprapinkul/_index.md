Nattanan is a PhD student co-advised by Profs. [Oliver Jia-Richards](https://ssl.engin.umich.edu/) and Gökçin Çınar in the Aerospace Engineering department at the University of Michigan. His research interests include space infrastructure development, space system design, and trajectory optimization. He is currently working on the spaceport assessment project, with an emphasis on developing a plume evolution model for launch vehicle ground cloud deposition, with the objective of assessing the local environmental impact from space launch activities. 

Nattanan earned a B.Eng. degree in Aerospace Engineering from Kasetsart University, Thailand. During his senior year, he had the opportunity to intern at the National Space Organization in Taiwan. He was primarily responsible for analyzing the electrical unit for Formosat-8 satellite and conducting research on micro-vibrations caused by the reaction wheel. After graduating, he received the Royal Thai Government Scholarship through the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency to further his studies in Aerospace Engineering. 

During his free time, Nattanan enjoys skiing, playing the saxophone, and traveling.
