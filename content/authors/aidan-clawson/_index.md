Aidan Clawson is a Graduate Student in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan. He is very interested in learning about all forms of sustainable aviation but is especially interested in hydrogen powered aircraft and the policies, infrastructure, and operations that come with it. For that exact reason, he joined the research team as a member of Aviationâ€™s Grand Challenge group.

As an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, Aidan was the structures lead for the project team M-SAAVE that is currently building a fixed wing autonomous medical supply delivery and aerial surveillance drone to be used in Africa. He helped the team complete preliminary research, design, and tests which resulted in a design for a test aircraft with plans to manufacture starting Fall 2022. For his senior design project, Aidan co-lead the design team that created the payload drop mechanism and bomb-bay doors that will be used on the test aircraft. Additionally, Aidan was the event planning chair for Cost Assistance for Resilient Engineers (CARE) which is a student organization that helps provide scholarships to students in need.

Aidan is the current Graduate Advisor for M-SAAVE as well as the vice-president of the Aerospace Graduate Student Advisory Committee (GSAC). Outside of sustainable aviation, he loves skiing, biking, skateboarding, basketball, and ultimate frisbee.
