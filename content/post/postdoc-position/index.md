The Integrated Design of Environmentally-friendly Aerospace Systems Laboratory is currently accepting applications for a Postdoctoral Researcher position. Our lab adopts a holistic approach to the design and operation of advanced aircraft concepts, considering the system-level and life-cycle environmental impacts. We explore transformative sustainable aviation technologies such as electrified propulsion and hydrogen-powered aircraft, leveraging probabilistic design methods, physics-based modeling, and systems engineering principles to navigate the challenges and uncertainties of this emerging field.

This postdoc position is available immediately and will remain open until filled.

**Subject areas:** Systems design, optimization, model-based systems engineering (MBSE), multi-physics modeling, surrogate modeling

**Research application:** Aircraft and propulsion system sizing, optimization, and design space exploration, electrified propulsion (including battery and/or hydrogen fuel cell hybrids), hydrogen propulsion, sustainable aviation technologies

**Job Description:**
The successful candidate will engage in collaborative research projects and conduct independent investigation into electrified and/or hydrogen-powered aircraft systems. They will contribute to multidisciplinary efforts, focusing on design, integration, and optimization of advanced concepts for sustainable aviation. The researcher will perform aircraft and propulsion system modeling, sizing, and simulations, utilizing multi-physics codes, and physics-based, data-driven and surrogate models. The researcher is expected to develop system models using MBSE methods and tools.

**Position Requirements:**
- Ph.D. degree in aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, or in a similar engineering field
- Willingness to learn SysML and MBSE
- Strong background in systems design and integration, and multidisciplinary analysis and optimization
- Proficiency in programming, especially in Matlab and Python
- Knowledge and keen interest in aircraft and propulsion system sizing and design
- Published or accepted journal papers

**Preferred (Bonus) Qualifications:**
- Background in MBSE, with experience in SysML
- Prior research experience in electrified aircraft and/or hydrogen-powered aircraft
- Experience in gas turbine engine component modeling and thermal management modeling
- Knowledge of deep machine learning (using TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) for multi-fidelity modeling, regression tasks, and parallel scientific computing
- Familiarity with predictive modeling, surrogate modeling, or reduced order modeling is advantageous. Experience in applying these methods to complex engineering systems would be an asset.

In our lab, we place great emphasis on collaboration with graduate and undergraduate students, striving to foster a positive and collegial culture.

**Location:** This position is based in Ann Arbor, MI, a vibrant university town that consistently rates as one of the best places to live in the US.

**Application:**
Interested candidates should email a resume, research statement (relevant to the topics described above), names and contact information of 3 references, and 2-3 select papers relevant to the research topics listed above to <span id="email"> cinar@umich.edu</span>.

  var emailAddress = "cinar@umich.edu";
  var emailLink = '<a href="mailto:' + emailAddress + '">' + emailAddress + '</a>';
  emailElement.innerHTML = emailLink;
</script>

**Background Screening:**
The University of Michigan conducts background checks on all job candidates upon acceptance of a contingent offer and may use a third party administrator to conduct background checks.  Background checks are performed in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

The University of Michigan is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer.
