title: "Washington Post quotes Çınar on Future of Flight"
subtitle: ""
summary: "
“We haven’t done anything this new with aircraft since forever. … Usually, our industry doesn’t do big changes. You do minimal changes over time. So there’s high risk, but there’s high reward,” said Gökçin Çınar, assistant professor of aerospace engineering, about battery-powered planes, which could cut emissions and make shorter plane routes financially feasible. *Washington Post*."
