Dr. Gökçin Çınar recently contributed her expertise to a CNN Travel article discussing the future of sustainable aviation. The article, titled "The Long Road to Guilt-Free Flying," explores innovative technologies aimed at reducing the environmental impact of air travel. Dr. Çınar's focus is on the challenges and innovations propelling us towards a more sustainable future in air travel. Each technology presents its own set of risks in application, maturation, and integration - not just within the aircraft, but also in infrastructure and airline networks. Çınar believes that a diverse portfolio of technologies is crucial for achieving the 2050 net zero goals.

Dr. Çınar is quoted saying, “*The technologies that we’re considering are mainly sustainable aviation fuels, which are being used today at a very minimal level, and two others that we could consider as being a bit more advanced: electrification and hydrogen*.”
