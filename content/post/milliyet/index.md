Çınar was featured on the front page news on one of the major newspapers in Turkey. The story covered her contributions to electrified aircraft propulsion research, PhD thesis on hybrid electric aircraft, and the product of my thesis: a sizing and synthesis tool for electrified aircraft and its propulsion architectures, called E-PASS.

The article also mentions her YouTube channel where she and her co-creator, Efe Yamaç Yarbaşı, post educational STEM videos in Turkish.
