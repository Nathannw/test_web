Aerospace America publishes a Year In Review edition every year, highlighting the major events reported by the AIAA's technical and integration committees. [**Click here to read the Electrified Aircraft Technology Technical Committee's article**](https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/year-in-review/electrified-aircraft-ground-and-flight-tests-continue-progress-toward-sustainable-aviation/) on Aerospace America's website. The article was authored by Gökçin Çınar and Phil Ansell, and contributed to by Peter de Bock, Natesa MacRae, Andrew Provenza, Linda Taylor, and David Tew. 

The Electrified Aircraft Technology Technical Committee supports the integration of electrified aircraft systems through the design, evaluation and application of key technologies, including components for propulsion, actuation, safety, airworthiness and thermal management.

Dr. Çınar previously contributed to two other articles in Aerospace America:

- **[Electrified aircraft flight tests moving at full throttle](https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/year-in-review/electrified-aircraft-flight-tests-moving-at-full-throttle/)** by Gokcin Cinar and Phil Ansell. Electrified Aircraft Technical Committee, December 2020
- **[Hybrid electric concepts move toward demonstration](https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/year-in-review/hybrid-electric-concepts-move-toward-demonstration/)** by Michael Ikeda, Gokcin Cinar, and John Nairus. Energy Optimized Aircraft Systems Integration Committee, December 2019
