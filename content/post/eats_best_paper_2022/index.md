Dr. Gökçin Çınar's paper titled the "Modeling and Simulation of a Parallel Hybrid Electric Regional Aircraft for the Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration (EPFD) Program"  received the *Electric Aircraft Technologies Symposium (EATS) Best Paper Award*. The paper was presented at the 2022 IEEE/AIAA Transportation Electrification Conference and Electric Aircraft Technologies Symposium (ITEC+EATS) held in Anaheim, California, on June 15-17, 2022. 

On a social media post on Twitter and Facebook, NASA Aeronautics congratulated Dr. Çınar and her co-authors, Yu Cai, Russell Denney, and Dr. Dimitri Mavris. @NASAaero said: "*Congrats @GeorgiaTech for winning best paper at #itec_conf, supporting NASA's Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration(EPFD)✈️This research focuses on advancing hybrid electric systems for turboprop engines, enabling a new gen of electrified aircraft. https://go.nasa.gov/3bcZUmN*"

**Modeling and Simulation of a Parallel Hybrid Electric Regional Aircraft for the Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration (EPFD) Program,** \
Gokcin Cinar, Yu Cai, Russell K. Denney, and Dimitri N. Mavris \
June 2022

**Abstract:**\
*This paper presents a parametric modeling and integrated sizing approach for a charge-depleting parallel hybrid electric aircraft. The hybrid powertrain model is integrated within a regional aircraft with an entry-into-service of 2030-2035.
In addition to the physical architecture, different operational modes enabled by the hybridization of the propulsion system are modeled parametrically. The modes of operation presented in this paper are peak power shaving, climb power electric boost, in-flight battery recharging, and electric taxi. The aircraft and powertrain sizing is performed within the multidisciplinary analysis and optimization environment, E-PASS. The consideration of the physical system and its operation together provides a holistic approach where the propulsion system and the airframe are designed under an optimized power and energy management strategy. The parametric nature of the work enables the design space exploration for electrification and lays the groundwork for future technology projection and uncertainty quantification studies. The developed capability is generic and can be applied to other aircraft classes. The work is done as part of the Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration program.*
